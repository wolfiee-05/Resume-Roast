        "If this resume were a dish, it would be a mystery meat casseroleâ€”no one knows whatâ€™s in it, and everyoneâ€™s afraid to try it!",
        "This resume is like a GPS with no signalâ€”just lost in the wilderness!",
        "Your experience section is like a magician's trickâ€”now you see it, now you donâ€™t!",
        "If this resume had a face, it would be the 'before' picture in a makeover show!",
        "This resume is so unoriginal, even Google couldnâ€™t autocomplete it!",
        "Reading this resume is like watching paint dryâ€”tedious and without excitement!",
        "If your achievements were any less impressive, theyâ€™d be hiding in the corner at a party!",
        "This resume is like a sitcom without a laugh trackâ€”awkward and a little uncomfortable!",
        "The skills section here is like a saladâ€”mostly filler, with just a few croutons of actual substance!",
        "This resume could be the poster child for 'how to bore your potential employer to death!'",
        "This looks like a group project where everyone contributed, but nobody cared about the final product!",
        "Your resume is like a bad haircutâ€”itâ€™s just trying too hard and completely misses the mark!",
        "If you put as much effort into this resume as you do into avoiding hard work, you'd be CEO by now!",
        
        # Indian meme-inspired roasts
        "This resume is as confusing as a Bollywood plot twistâ€”where did the character development go?",
        "If your resume was a chai, it would be missing the masalaâ€”just plain and boring!",
        "This resume looks like it was written by a person who learned English from watching Bollywood moviesâ€”lots of drama, no clarity!",
        "Your resume is like a cricket match that never endsâ€”so much time wasted for such little result!",
        "This resume is like a long line at the local darshiniâ€”everyoneâ€™s waiting, but nobodyâ€™s getting anything done!",
        "Reading this is like watching the 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai' climaxâ€”everyoneâ€™s confused and no one knows what happened!",
        "Your achievements are like my neighbor's noisy familyâ€”everyone knows they exist, but nobody really cares!",
        "This resume is as relatable as a 'Yeh Hai Mohabbatein' episodeâ€”too much melodrama and not enough sense!",
        "If this resume were an Indian meme, it would definitely be a 'Why this kolaveri di?' moment!",
        "This looks like the 'first draft' of a Karan Johar movie scriptâ€”too much fluff, not enough substance!",
        "This resume is like the plot of 'Gully Boy'â€”great concept, but the execution is all over the place!"
